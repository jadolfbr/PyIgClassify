#Cutoff History:
#6/22/13: Change score cutoffs to lowest true domains from pdbaa using Roland's results.  Note that these are not final, as some should probably be a bit lower.  This will however, increase stringency manually to the pdb.  We may need to keep manually changing these values like Pfam.  Damn.

#6/23/13:  Changing Evalue cutoffs, and score vs evalue is entirely linear. Changing to what Pfam uses. 

#6/23/13: Changing score cutoffs for stringency, but we should end up with a bit more.  From an email:
#Everything below 98 is not really an antibody. vpreB is a different gene and not a rearranged gene. The shark vnar is just weird.
#The sequences at 55.4 and below are some kind of catfish Ig-like protein but not an antibody.
#So if you want to be stringent you could set the cutoff to 90 and we should monitor the low-scoring hits on a periodic basis.
#The TCRs mostly work but there are a couple of delta misassignments. At the moment I don't think we'll have anything on the website about those and just keep that in reserve for a subsequent project. So the scoring issue is even clearer when just considering the antibodies.

#Cutoff History:
#6/22/13: Change score cutoffs to lowest true domains from pdbaa using Roland's results.  Note that these are not final, as some should probably be a bit lower.  This will however, increase stringency manually to the pdb.  We may need to keep manually changing these values like Pfam.  Damn.
